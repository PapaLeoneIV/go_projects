# Golang Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Golang Project repository! This project is a testament to my journey in learning and mastering Go programming, featuring a variety of modules and programs that showcase my progress and dedication.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories, each containing different components and exercises:

### Addition Game
The Addition Game project is an interactive exercise designed to improve arithmetic skills. It includes a set of problems provided in a CSV file and a Go program that reads and presents these problems to the user for solving.

### Exercise
This directory contains miscellaneous Go programming exercises that cover a range of topics and concepts. It serves as a practice ground for experimenting with different aspects of the Go language.

### Hello World
The Hello World project demonstrates basic Go programming principles through simple greeting programs. It includes modules for generating greeting messages and a main program that prints these greetings to the console.

### Libft (Library Functions)
The Libft project is a collection of utility functions commonly used in programming. It includes string manipulation functions, character checks, and conversion functions. This library is a handy toolkit for various programming tasks and exercises.

## How to Run
### Prerequisites
- Go compiler

### Compilation
To compile and run the programs, navigate to the desired directory and use the Go tools. For example, to run the Addition Game:

```bash
cd additiongame
go run main.go
