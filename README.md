Golang Project

Welcome to the Golang Project repository! This project is a testament to my journey in learning and mastering Go programming, featuring a variety of modules and programs that showcase my progress and dedication.
Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each containing different components and exercises:
Addition Game

The Addition Game project is an interactive exercise designed to improve arithmetic skills. It includes a set of problems provided in a CSV file and a Go program that reads and presents these problems to the user for solving.
Exercise

This directory contains miscellaneous Go programming exercises that cover a range of topics and concepts. It serves as a practice ground for experimenting with different aspects of the Go language.
Hello World

The Hello World project demonstrates basic Go programming principles through simple greeting programs. It includes modules for generating greeting messages and a main program that prints these greetings to the console.
Libft (Library Functions)

The Libft project is a collection of utility functions commonly used in programming. It includes string manipulation functions, character checks, and conversion functions. This library is a handy toolkit for various programming tasks and exercises.
Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and navigate to the desired directory. Each directory contains its own go.mod file, so you can run and test individual components separately.
